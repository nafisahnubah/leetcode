# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
#
# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.
# You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.
# Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.
#
# Example:
# Input: prices = [10,1,5,6,7,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Buy prices[1] and sell prices[4], profit = 7 - 1 = 6

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        maxProfit = 0
        minBuy = prices[0]
        for price in prices:
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - minBuy)
            minBuy = min(minBuy, price)
        return maxProfit
