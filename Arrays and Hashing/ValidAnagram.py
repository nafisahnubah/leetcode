# Valid Anagram
# Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.
#
# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"
# Output: false
#
# Constraints:
# s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
